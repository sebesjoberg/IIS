# Data

Data should be put into a map called "data", this data map is gitignored and should be provided by the user of this repo, the creators of this repo used the DiffusionFer dataset

User perception to-do:

1. Extract action units from data pictures
2. Combine all au values and their corresponding label (emotion) into a big csv file to train the model on
3. Find a suitable model, maybe compare several?, and train it on our big data
4. Save the model
5. Create a function that takes a picture as input, extracts au values and classifies the emotions based on our model

User interaction to-do:

1. Define, in a flow chart manner, a conversation flow that is based on the detected emotion of the human
2. Inputs shall be current emotion, speech and a counter that counts on which question we are on (how long into the conversation we are)
   When the counter reaches max (eg 4) then the bartender reccomends/serves a drink and resets the counter.
   If reset, one idea it to switch the face and vioce of the bartender.
3. Convert this into code in the userInteraction function that is called by the main function in furhatBartender

Fun ideas to add if we have time:
Bartender that keeps track of your name
Bartenders have different personalities
