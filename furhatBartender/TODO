gaze control
more emotionally versitaile interactions, eg tone of message
facial expressions on furhat
also idle animations when talking, perhaps start a thread when listening for user input that does some random idle animations
the above could also depend on user emotions some, eg different idle animations when suer is happy and so on

also bypass the whole interaction system when a customer simply goes up to furhat and orders drink
slightly deeper interaction, allowing the user to say no to their drink recomendation and pick something else (from menu)
if not on menu perhaps simply saying nope that is not a valid drink you will get the recomendation instead

pause the furhat until face is actually visible in picture (before interaction chain starts has to detect face)
flush the emotion detection list
